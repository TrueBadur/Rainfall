At first as usual trying objdump.
We see that there is only main function, but it's very big, so we decide to try
another approach.
Download and install retdec from avast (https://github.com/avast/retdec/releases).
Run it on level8 binary to get understanding of what happening.
It decompiles in not a very readable code, but still better than asm.
From the code and the behavior of program we understand that there is do while loop
in which fgets called and input is compared to words "auth ", "reset", "service" and "login".
After thoroughly walking through the code we understood that on "auth " allocate
happens and placed in global1, on "service" result of allocation is placed to global2,
on "reset" - global1 is freed, but more valuable is that on "login" there is a check
that in *(global1 + 32) is not 0 depending on that check whether to call system or
print "Password:".
So by typing in "auth ", "service", "service", "login" we get shell.
