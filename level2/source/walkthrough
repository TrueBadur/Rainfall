- We have a binary here so:
this algo will apply almost to any binary file to collect info about:
1) run w and w/o arguments
2) objdump -d ./<binary> | less #to see asm
3) objdump -s -j .rodata ./<binary> | less #to see strings
4) ltrace ./<binary> w and w/o arguments #to see lib calls
5) gdb <binary> (layout asm, 
	run < <args>,
	run ,
	disas <function name>, 
	breakpoints on addresses, 
	info frame, set $<regname>=<value>)

 
   0x080484fb <+39>:	and    $0xb0000000,%eax
   0x08048500 <+44>:	cmp    $0xb0000000,%eax

this piece of code restricts us to set eip to stack address

converts in C in something like:
(eip & 0xb0000000) == 0xb0000000 printf
else puts

rest of the code after comparison seems to be useless

so we can try to set eip to 'ret' address to avoid rest of the code after comparison

eip = &ret

after execution of 'ret' eip will increment and start executing next command

we can try to set eip + 1 to 'system' function with enviromental variable address 
export EXPLOIT="/bin/sh"

how to find out EXPLOIT address ? 

we can right a piece of code:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("%p\n", getenv("EXPLOIT"));
return 0;
}

and pass it like a argument to the function system

ret address: 0x0804853e
system address: 0xb7e6b060
EXPLOIT address: 0xbffff88b

NOTE: we need to adjust where EXPLOIT argument should be written on stack


SEG FAULT WAS CAUGHT

Next way: 
however we cant put into eip stack address we see strdup that returns heap allocated memory
always the same

we can set eip after gets to this allocated string and bytes of SHELLCODE
SHELLCODE helps uses insn encoding bytes to enter /bin/sh
just exactly what we need

strdup return value is: 0x804a008


so firstly there is a buffer with a size 76 
to rewrite eip we need to enter 80 bytes (because there is a another pointer allocated on stack)
and than hand written aligning to make shellcode work
