Now we are working not with plane c, but with pravoslavniy c++.
Long story short there is a class there 2 instances of which is allocated.
After struggling with gdb we found out that class stores pointer to its methods within it.
And at the end of the main function this method (operator+) is called.
So with the help of memcpy we will replace pointer to the operator method with the pointer
to our injected shellcode.
